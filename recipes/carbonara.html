        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>230 grams thick cut bacon</li>
            <li>4 ounces Parmesan or Romano cheese or a blend of the two</li>    
            <li>3 large eggs </li>
            <li>Freshly Ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>   
            <li>retained starchy pasta water</li>
            <li>450 grams of spaghettini</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        
            <li>Whisk egg in a bowl and add 90% of your grated cheese</li>
            <li>Add freshly ground black pepper into this mixture and whisk</li>
            <li>Cut bacon into large chunks</li>
            <li>Add bacon into a cold non stick pan and turn the heat on med/high</li>
            <li>When the bacon starts to sizzle begin to boil a pot of water and add salt to it</li>
            <li>Once the bacon is fully cooked and the fat has rendered out, strain out the grease, keeping only 2 tablespoons of fat in the pan.</li>
            <li>Return the pan to medium low heat and add minced garlic. Saute for one minute and then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>When your water starts to boil over add your spaghettini to it and stir occasionally to avoid sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked noodles to the pan with the bacon along with ⅓ cup of pasta water.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and cheese mixture to the pan. Toss riggorously and keep it moving. </li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning and assess for thickening. If it needs to be thicker, add more cheese (1 ounce at a time) and mix rigorously.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
