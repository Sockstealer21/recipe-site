        <h2>Creamy and sweet pasta sauce</h2>
        <p> This absolutely amazing bell pepper sauce has an extremely unique flavour
            compared to typical pasta sauces one might think of and not only does it 
            taste great but its also a very healthy vegeterian sauce. This recipe 
            requires a blender in order to smooth it out and prefferably san
            marzano tomatoes or tomatoes in their juices if san marzano tomatoes
            are too difficult to obtain.
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 whole bell peppers any colour</li>
          <li>1 onion</li>
          <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>3 tbps spicy fermented peppers with the oil they come in</li>
          <li>Red pepper flake to wanted spice level</li>
          <li>500ml heavy cream</li>
          <li>However much pasta you wish to consume</li>
          <li>Enough olive oil to coat the bottom of a large skillet</li>
          <li>1 can of san marzano tomatoes or 1 can of whole tomatoes with its juices</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the bell peppers, onions and garlic all into thin slices.         </li>
            <li>Add as much red pepper flake as you want to the garlic slices (its very difficult to over spice this dish).</li>
            <li>Heat up your large skillet using med/high heat and add olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add your bell peppers into the skillet and cook until they're slightly transparent while not allowing them to stick onto the pan.</li>
            <li>Add your onions into your large skillet cook until transluscent.</li>
            <li>Add both the garlic slices and the spicy fermented peppers with some of its oil.</li>
            <li>After the garlic starts to become translucent Add the entire can of tomatoes and mix everything together and wait for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lower your heat to low/med and add your heavy cream and mix everything and simmer for 5 mins.        </li>
            <li>Load everything into your blender. (I recommend scooping your solids in first then pouring the liquid in.)</li>
            <li>Blitz the concoction in your blender whilst regularly allowing heat to escape from the blender.</li>
        </ol>
